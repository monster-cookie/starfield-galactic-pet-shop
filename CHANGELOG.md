# V1.0 Permutations

## V1.0.2
* Added Aceles and Vampire as rare pets
* New AI package based on follower on ship but this means I need a AI package for an outpost and I actually need to make an outpost lol
* New AI package seems to make the glitching though the roof less likely. I think the cause is the collision layer is large then the the mesh cause of scaling so they punch thought the roof on any stumble to stepping up anywhere on the floor. Not sure how to fix the collision error. 

## V1.0.1
* Added foxbat as rare
* Attempting to work on spawning point so they are less likely to go through the roof but I think they are just using hatches
* Added scaling to the pet bed menu.
* Adding a return to pet bed function to pet bed menu for errant pets that go wondering around on the roof. 

## V1.0.0
* Initial Release
